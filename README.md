### Data Source

The dataset utilized in this analysis was obtained from an onlne data vault. The data provided valuable insights into demographic and behavioral factors influencing insurance charges, enabling us to conduct a comprehensive analysis of risk profiling and customer behavior within the insurance industry.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
To ensure the dataset was ready for analysis, a series of data cleaning and preparation steps were undertaken using Power Query in Microsoft Excel. The objective was to transform the raw data into a structured format suitable for subsequent analysis while addressing any inconsistencies or missing values.

1. Handling Missing Values:
- The dataset was inspected for missing values in each column, particularly in the Age and BMI fields.
- Missing values were addressed through various techniques, such as imputation using mean or median values or removing rows with missing data, depending on the nature and extent of missingness.
2. Data Transformation:
- Age and BMI variables were grouped into predefined categories using conditional columns in Power Query.
- For Age, categories such as 'Young Adults' (18-24 years), 'Early Adults' (25-34 years),'Mid Adults' (35- 44 years) and 'Seniors' (45 - 64 years) were created based on predefined age ranges.
Similarly, BMI categories were defined as 'Underweight' (<18.5), 'Normal Weight' (18.5-24.9), 'Overweight' (25-29.9), and 'Obese' (30+), facilitating analysis based on BMI classifications.
3. Index Column Addition:
- An index column was added to the dataset using the 'Add Index Column' feature in Power Query.
- This index column served as a unique identifier for each record in the dataset, enabling easier tracking and referencing of individual observations during the analysis process.
