### Data Source

The dataset utilized in this analysis was obtained from an onlne data vault. The data provided valuable insights into demographic and behavioral factors influencing insurance charges, enabling us to conduct a comprehensive analysis of risk profiling and customer behavior within the insurance industry.

---
### Data Cleaning and Preparation
To ensure the dataset was ready for analysis, a series of data cleaning and preparation steps were undertaken using Power Query in Microsoft Excel. The objective was to transform the raw data into a structured format suitable for subsequent analysis while addressing any inconsistencies or missing values.

1. Handling Missing Values:
- The dataset was inspected for missing values in each column, particularly in the Age and BMI fields.
- Missing values were addressed through various techniques, such as imputation using mean or median values or removing rows with missing data, depending on the nature and extent of missingness.
2. Data Transformation:
- Age and BMI variables were grouped into predefined categories using conditional columns in Power Query.
- For Age, categories such as 'Young Adults' (18-24 years), 'Early Adults' (25-34 years),'Mid Adults' (35- 44 years) and 'Seniors' (45 - 64 years) were created based on predefined age ranges.
Similarly, BMI categories were defined as 'Underweight' (<18.5), 'Normal Weight' (18.5-24.9), 'Overweight' (25-29.9), and 'Obese' (30+), facilitating analysis based on BMI classifications.
3. Index Column Addition:
- An index column was added to the dataset using the 'Add Index Column' feature in Power Query.
- This index column served as a unique identifier for each record in the dataset, enabling easier tracking and referencing of individual observations during the analysis process.

### Analysis and Findings


1. Problem Statement 1:
"Examine how demographic and behavioral variables influence insurance charges within our customer base."

Findings:

- Age has a significant impact on insurance charges, with older individuals generally experiencing higher charges compared to younger counterparts.
- Smokers tend to have substantially higher insurance charges compared to non-smokers, indicating the importance of smoking status as a risk factor.
- Regional variations exist in insurance charges, with certain regions exhibiting higher average charges than others, suggesting potential geographical risk factors.

2. Problem Statement 2:
"Analyze the correlation between demographic factors and behavioral factors with insurance charges to identify key drivers of risk and customer behavior."

Findings:

- There is a positive correlation between BMI and insurance charges, indicating that higher BMI levels are associated with increased insurance risk and higher charges.
- The number of children also correlates positively with insurance charges, suggesting that individuals with more dependents may require higher coverage levels, leading to increased charges.
- Age demonstrates a strong correlation with insurance charges, with charges generally increasing as age advances, reflecting higher risk profiles associated with older age groups.

3. Problem Statement 3:
"Investigate regional variations in insurance charges and explore how demographic and behavioral factors contribute to these differences, aiming to optimize pricing strategies and market segmentation."

Findings:

- Regional differences in insurance charges are influenced by a combination of demographic and behavioral factors, with age, smoking status, and BMI playing significant roles.
- Certain regions with higher proportions of smokers or individuals with higher BMI levels tend to have elevated insurance charges, highlighting the importance of considering regional risk factors in pricing strategies.
- Market segmentation based on regional variations in demographic and behavioral characteristics could enable more targeted pricing and marketing approaches tailored to specific geographical areas.

4. Problem Statement 4:
"Explore the impact of lifestyle choices, such as smoking status and BMI, on insurance charges, and assess how these factors interact with demographic variables like age and sex to shape risk profiles and customer preferences."

Findings:

- Smoking status emerges as a major determinant of insurance charges, with smokers experiencing substantially higher charges compared to non-smokers across all age groups and regions.
- BMI also significantly influences insurance charges, with obese individuals facing higher charges compared to those with normal BMI levels, particularly in older age groups.
- The interaction between demographic variables (such as age and sex) and lifestyle choices (smoking status and BMI) further amplifies the impact on insurance charges, highlighting the importance of considering multiple factors in risk assessment and pricing.

5. Problem Statement 5:
"Assess the relationship between the number of children and insurance charges, considering demographic and behavioral factors, to understand the insurance needs of families and inform product development and marketing strategies."

Findings:

- The number of children positively correlates with insurance charges, indicating that families with more children tend to require higher coverage levels, leading to increased charges.
- Demographic and behavioral factors such as age, smoking status, and BMI interact with the number of children to shape insurance charges, with older parents and smokers with children facing higher charges.
